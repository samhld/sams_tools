# For analyzing InfluxDB input data

As InfluxDB is a schema-on-write database, it is important to understand and optimize the format and shape of data that you are writing to it.

Initialize an instance of Plotter with a block of text (*will support files later*): `plotter = Plotter(text)

### Terminal:


### Web UI (roadmap?):
